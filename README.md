# Shape Calculator

## Purpose
Mathematical formulas are hard to memorize and can be time-consuming to implement. A solution to this problem is the Shape Calculator.

## How does it work?
This project is made in Python and it is a console-based program. First, there is user input where the user is asked questions about the shape. These questions then access the formula that is stored in the code in order to find the accurate measurement of a shape.

## Requirements
- Python 3
